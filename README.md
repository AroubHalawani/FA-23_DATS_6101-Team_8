We’ve chosen “Patient Survival Prediction” as our research topic. From this dataset, we’re going to
determine whether a patient lives or dies based on numerous parameters, like heart rate, creatinine,
bilirubin levels etc. Keeping the medical history of patients in mind we can predict the survival rate, by
training an ML model with the data and testing it with different information. This research topic is a
practical use case scenario as it will help doctors in getting to know the exact health condition of a
patient without running much diagnosis. This data and the model built on this can save both time as well
as lives of people. From this data we can also infer the significance/ impact of Intensive Care Units and
check whether they really improve a patient’s health or not .The dataset we have is in its raw form. We
will preprocess (EDA)/ clean the dataset first which involves taking care of missing values and then go
for feature importance, splitting the data for training and testing and move towards model building.

1. Is there a heightened risk of mortality associated with alcohol consumption?
2. Among different age groups (children, adults, and senior citizens), which demographic exhibits the
highest mortality rate?
3. Can the presence of medical conditions like diabetes, hepatic failure, or other medical conditions
impact an individual's likelihood of mortality?
4. What is the gender distribution of deaths in the hospital, with regard to male and female ratios?
